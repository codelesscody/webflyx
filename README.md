This is a basic repository to learn the basics of git and github through the boot.dev "Learn Git" course at https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-git

### About GitHub:
GitHub is the most popular website for Git repositories (projects) online. That is, for hosting "remotes" on a central website. GitHub serves several purposes:

    As a backup of all your code on the cloud in case something happens to your computer
    As a central place to share your code and collaborate on it with others
    As a public portfolio for your coding projects

Git != GitHub

It's important to understand that Git and GitHub are not the same! Git is an open-source command line tool for managing code files. GitHub and its primary competitors, GitLab and Bitbucket, are commercial web products that use Git. Their websites give us a way to store our code that's managed by Git.
